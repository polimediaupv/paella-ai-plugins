00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
A hello everyone! My name is Enos and today we're going to be

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.300
talking about how to use hand gestures in oral presentations.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.710
These are the two goals of this parliamentary video. The

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.350
first goal is to provide a general overview of how to use hand gestures in a presentation,

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.610
and the second goal is to outline the different types of gestures

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.610
that we can use and how to use them in an efficient way.

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.890
The contents of this parliamentary video will be the following. First of all,

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.750
I'll begin with an introduction, which will be followed by an

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.890
explanation of hand gestures in oral presentations. I will then

10
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.850
move on to structural hand gestures and content hand gestures to then

11
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.920
finish up with some conclusions:

12
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.380
Why are gestures helpful in an oral presentation? Have you ever

13
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.370
asked yourself that when you watch a Tiktok video when you

14
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.950
use an Instagram post when you watch a president address an audience,

15
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.870
Do they use gestures? How do they use these gestures? So these

16
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.520
are three reasons why gestures are helpful when

17
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.680
when presenting to an audience. The first one is that gestures

18
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.170
can help you captivate the audience by getting their attention.

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.930
Tongue's are the first thing that we look at when we see someone new

20
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.970
as well as the eyes. But eyes don't move Hands, however, do

21
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.210
and movement attracts our attention. It's not the same if I'm just presenting like this

22
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.390
that if I am presenting moving my hands.

23
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.320
Secondly, gestures help you narrate and illustrate your texts. Imagine

24
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.570
you're talking about you're talking about a very tall man.

25
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.390
Or perhaps you're talking about a very tall man.

26
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.580
Or a very short man Or a very short man.

27
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.360
So here, gestures can also help you basically illustrate or

28
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.020
define characterized what or who you're talking about.

29
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.360
And third, gestures can help you structure speech. This is what

30
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.770
we will talk about in a minute, which is structural gesture. Use

31
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.060
gestures in oral presentations. We've spoken about the importance of hands.

32
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.240
Hands are one of the key elements in body language. We use our

33
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.680
hands for many things in communication to enrich and reinforce

34
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.230
the content of your message.

35
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.450
In example, would you like some cake Or it would you like some cake

36
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.010
This gesture invites the audience to participate in the way

37
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.450
that we are offering something to them. Another example would be

38
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.940
how are you today? How are you Today This gesture helps pinpoint

39
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.190
exactly who is the addressee of your question,

40
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.710
and here we divide gestures between structural gestures and content gestures.

41
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.170
Let's see what this means.

42
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.050
Structural hand gestures collaborate with textual

43
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.160
and resources and connect us to ease the transition of ideas into a text.

44
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.650
You can say first, second third, on the one hand, on the other hand

45
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.990
to wrap up. Additionally, all of these gestures, they

46
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.350
basically illustrate how an idea changes into another idea.

47
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.950
How about an example?

48
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.160
This presentation is structured in three parts. First of all,

49
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.510
the introduction will address the role of metaphor in everyday speech.

50
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.780
Secondly, I will explain different types of metaphors. Thirdly,

51
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.630
I will share some findings of a recent study of metaphor. To

52
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.890
conclude, I will summarize the main ideas of the talk.

53
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.850
Now, let's see how this changes. This presentation is structured

54
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.800
into three parts. First of all, the presentation will address

55
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.230
the role of metaphor in everyday speech. Secondly, it will explain

56
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.910
different types of metaphors. Thirdly, I will share some findings

57
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.720
of the study of metaphor. And to conclude, I will summarize the

58
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.300
main ideas of the talk. Can you see how gestures change the

59
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.790
efficiency of the transition between ideas in this text?

60
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.390
Another example, using metaphors in a text can facilitate its correct understanding,

61
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.230
but it may also add a layer of complexity. On the one hand, metaphors

62
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.910
enable a more direct way of speaking about complex topics such as emotions.

63
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.140
On the other hand, they often require the speaker to have the capacity to understand

64
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.420
the points of similarity between the source and the target domain.

65
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.320
How about using metaphor in the test can facilitate its correct understanding,

66
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.060
but it may also add a layer of complexity on the one hand. Multiples

67
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.100
enable a more direct way of speaking about complex topics such as emotions,

68
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.480
And on the other hand, they often require the speaker to have

69
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.130
the capacity to understand the points of similarity between the source

70
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.090
and the target domain.

71
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.510
How have gestures improved this text? Please give this some thought.

72
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.130
So content hand gestures serve the purpose of visually illustrating

73
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.310
elements that appear in The text? We can have a circle gesture

74
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.780
or a tall vs. short gesture or a crazy gesture. How do these gestures

75
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.120
change the way we portray or define items elements participants in our text.

76
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.210
Let's look at another example. I once knew a very short man

77
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.690
who was however very fierce. He was afraid of nothing at all.

78
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.190
He once received a mysterious box at the entrance of his house

79
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.500
and see how it changes into. I once knew a very short man who

80
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.410
was however very fierce. He was afraid of nothing at all.

81
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.920
He once received a mysterious box at the entrance of his house.

82
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.330
Again, just change the way we get attracted, captivated by

83
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.680
a text and the way we define different elements of this text.

84
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.190
So to conclude, hand gestures are very powerful tool and also

85
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.560
a very useful tool to strengthen the impact of your oral presentation.

86
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.610
Both structural and content, hand gestures reinforce the text.

87
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.930
Content gestures help illustrate elements of the narration

88
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.390
and structural gestures serve the purpose of reinforcing the link between ideas.

89
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.620
Thank you so much for listening.

90
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.410
