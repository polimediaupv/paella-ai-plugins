* **How does Newton's law of universal gravitation relate to the concept of inverse square law?**
	+ Answer: Newton's law of universal gravitation states that the force of gravity between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This embodies the inverse square law, meaning as the distance doubles, the gravitational force becomes one-fourth of its original strength.

* **How did Kepler's precise study of planetary orbits influence Newton's work on universal gravitation?**
	+ Answer: Kepler's laws of planetary motion provided Newton with crucial empirical evidence. The laws' precision, especially regarding elliptical orbits and the relationship between orbital radius and period, influenced Newton to formulate his law of universal gravitation, explaining the underlying force driving these observed motions.

* **What is the historical significance of Principia Mathematica in the development of classical mechanics?**
	+ Answer: Published by Isaac Newton in 1687, Principia Mathematica is historically significant as it laid the foundations for classical mechanics. It introduced the laws of motion and universal gravitation, providing a unified framework that explained terrestrial and celestial phenomena, revolutionizing physics, astronomy, and mathematics.

* **In what ways did Archimedes' work on calculus and geometric shapes contribute to later scientific discoveries?**
	+ Note: Archimedes primarily contributed to the development of geometry and the method of exhaustion (a precursor to integration), not calculus directly, as calculus was developed later by Newton and Leibniz.
	+ Answer: Archimedes' innovative use of the method of exhaustion (precursor to integration) and his work on geometric shapes significantly influenced the development of calculus. His discoveries in buoyancy, center of gravity, and the principle of leverage also laid groundwork for advancements in physics and engineering, inspiring later scientists like Galileo and Newton.

* **What role did mathematical integration play in resolving problems related to the inverse square law?**
	+ Answer: Mathematical integration played a pivotal role in resolving problems related to the inverse square law by enabling the calculation of accumulative effects over varying distances. It allowed for the precise determination of gravitational potential, orbital trajectories under inverse square forces (like gravity and electromagnetism), and areas/volumes of shapes defined by such laws, providing solutions to complex problems in physics and astronomy.
